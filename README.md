# Quadtree Search in C

This repository contains an implementation of the Quadtree search algorithm in C. This project was created as a side project, inspired by the concepts I learned during my Algorithms and Data Structures course while pursuing my Master's in Software Engineering.

## Overview

A Quadtree is a spatial partitioning data structure commonly used to efficiently search for points in a two-dimensional space. This implementation focuses on building a Quadtree and performing search operations, highlighting how this data structure can optimize spatial queries.

## Features

- **Insertion:** Efficiently insert points into the Quadtree.
- **Search:** Perform fast spatial searches to find points within a given area.
- **Visualization:** (Optional) Simple console output to visualize the Quadtree structure.
- **Written in C:** The project is implemented entirely in C, demonstrating low-level memory management and data structure manipulation.

## Why Quadtree?

Quadtrees are widely used in various fields such as computer graphics, geographical information systems (GIS), collision detection in gaming, and more. This project showcases how the Quadtree algorithm can be implemented in C, offering insights into spatial data management.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- GCC or any standard C compiler.
- Basic knowledge of C programming and data structures.

### Compilation

To compile the project, use the following command:

```bash
make
